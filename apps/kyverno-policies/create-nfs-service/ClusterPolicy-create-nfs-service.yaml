# TODO:
# Kyverno policy to create the NFS service for this cluster.
# This is to have an FQDN for the NFS server that servers all the data/pvcs in the cluster.
# The process is as follows:
# 1. Create an EndpointSlice object for the NFS server.
#   a. The EndpointSlice is constructed from a ConfigMap that contains the NFS server's IP addresses.
#      The ConfigMap is created/updated by ansible, when installing the server, if it has the "nfs_server" role.
#      ConfigMap example:
#        apiVersion: v1
#        kind: ConfigMap
#        metadata:
#          name: nfs-server-ips
#          namespace: kube-system
#          annotations:
#            policy.slfhst.io/generate-nfs-service: "true"
#        data:
#          ips: "x.y.z.a,x.y.z.b"
# 2. Create a Service object that selects the EndpointSlice.
# The service is named "nfs-server" and has a port named "nfs" that matches the EndpointSlice port.
# The service is created in the "kube-system" namespace.
